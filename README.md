## My Experience:
As an aspiring cybersecurity professional, I was excited to begin my tryhackme learning experience with this course. 
Throughout this course I learned about different careers in cybersecurity, deffensive vs offensive security, etc.
Overall, I enjoyed the course as I was able to get hands on experience with both defensive and offensive tools.

## Practice:
### This section will go over my hands on experience for this course:
